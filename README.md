WIP Do Not Use for Now


A big button frontend library for those who thumble around to click on stuff

`npm install thumble --save-dev`

For those that prefer to integrate `node_modules/thumble/{styles,scripts}`
into your grunt|gulp build process, (which you probably should).

And if you insist ...

`bower install thumble`
