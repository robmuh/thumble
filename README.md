thumble
=======

*Keeping this around for nostalgic sake. This was fun to make back in
the day (before CSS Grid and Flexbox). I think it was my first Node
project.*

WIP Do Not Use for Now

A collapsible, big button pad web app frontend widget for those who
thumble around to click on stuff and also want near-zero screen navigation
when off.


Install
=======

For those that prefer to integrate `node_modules/thumble/{styles,scripts}`
into your grunt|gulp build process, (which you probably should):

`npm install thumble --save-dev`

And if you insist ...

`bower install thumble`
